          <h2>Get to know me!</h2>
          <p>
            I graduated from Princeton University with a Bachelor's Degree in
            Computer Science, which ignited my spark for technology.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now, that spark is fueled by my curiosityâ€”how products are built,
            the challenges solved, and how I&rsquo;d approach them. This
            curiosity drives me to explore new technologies, refine my
            problem-solving skills, and continuously grow as a developer. More
            than anything, I love the process of transforming an idea into a
            fully functional, seamless experience that people could rely on.
          </p>

          <p>
            If you have an exciting opportunity that resonates with my skills
            and experience, I&rsquo;d love to connect and collaborate!
          </p>
